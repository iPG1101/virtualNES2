# virtualNES (Customizable* NES for mobile phones)


   I decided since I was playing around with NES games, to make them work on my phone. It is based off of <a href='https://www.github.com/koenkivits/nesnes'>koenkivit's New ECMA Script Nintendo Entertainment System emulator (NESNes for short).</a>

   Please make themes and send them to me (a controller png is enough, just draw a cutout for game's `<canvas>`)


Todo:
 - Make it work with bluetooth controllers (I will need testers)
 - Modes (Virtual Reality mode, and then Vertical Mode)
 - Fix bugs with disconnected WiFi or bluetooth
 - More?

Look at the 'default.vt' (default visual theme) folder as a template - and to make yours a repo (so it can be added once I add repo functionality) - make a file 'visualtheme.json' in the root of your domain (so if it was example.com/visualtheme.json, the repo would be example.com) that links to your theme, so mine would be: 
` {"name": "iPhoneGuy1101's Repo", themes: ['default.vt']}`
  
Send me a png idea and I will convert it when I get time (weekends)


*Customizable) Themes are not added yet, wait until either Saturday (tomorrow, 6.1.2018) or Sunday (7.1.2018).
